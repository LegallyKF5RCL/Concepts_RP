Research plan:
-what should the frequencies be?  Common individual frequencies and band centers, ie Florescent light ballasts, FM, business comms, Wifi, Cell, industrial processes
-what MCUs should be used? based on popularity and flexibility, ie a more flexible or newer family member of a popular chip may be a better choice, to maximize usefulness of results
-what should the power levels be for each frequency?
-field measurements of power levels for determining appropriate ones for testing maybe

Timeline
-should there be a figure of it?
-determine frequencies and power levels, testing period, specific MCU models
-find testing site, determine cost
-design boards, send out for manufacturing
-assign/hire personnel
-assemble boards/hardware
-perform tests
-create report

budget:
-MCUs
-boards
-facility: rent? probably, find out how much that costs
-Power: comes with facility?
-Health & safety: can't microwave researchers/technicians
-personnel? monitoring, documentation, setup, admin
-research papers (for frequencies, power levels, MCUs to test, etc

Background:
-Clock source options and in-depth on internal oscillators
-RF exposure environments


Brian says....
frequencies....pick em....
it'll be in a faraday cage, blacked out?  Control will be in cage too (with no generator)
temperature control specifics, how, what drift, what mitigation (climate control and precision measurement), chip temp vs ambient temp, internal heating, RF heating, light heating
spaaaaaace... woot
AM, FM, cell (900, 1800, 1900...), Wifi (2.4G, 5G)
personnel stuff...I'll be the emperor of Japan



Research plan:
someone else should be able to fully reproduce the experiment with no further input from you
no detailed personnel stuff

MSP430, 1+ 32-bit MCU/DSC
PIC12F???, Pic16F????, PIC18??? dsPIC33E????, PIC32MZ????


calculate plausible power density based on Tx power , dBi, and sensible distances
how to measure?  that shoiuld be defined already, research facilities

Power levels:
2.4GHz: 10cm, 1m, 10m WiFi, worst-case microwave oven
5GHz: 10cm, 1m, 10m WiFi,
WiFi: 4W max EIRP, 100mW max power at AP typical, rubber duck antenna 2.2dBi 2.4, 3.5dBi 5.
degrades by 1/d^2....power density is [1/(4*pi*r^2)]*10^(g/10)

18dBi for cell antennas
used 40W per sector (3 sectors) for power output
850 & 1900 MHz chosen due to usage by many carriers, and distance from WiFi & TV bands.

UHF TV gain: 14dBi methinks, power 1MW

FM broadcast gain: 5dBi est, power

measure with frequency counter, based on clock-out pin
or use a spectrum analyzer if needed - assign person with this skill
prolly one at a time, to avoid them interfering with each other and if they can't test multiple devices at once (spatial consistency of power level)

irradiate for 1 hour each to have adequate drift
measure frequency continuously so we can have a graph of it over time

diagram of board, maybe
testing flowchart


add stuff
gonna meet 3 tomorrow


Test Antenna - resonant dipole, about 2.15dbi gain at the middle, half-wave except 1MHz

1MHz:

heierarchy
levels from DoE....ya want that


single ring per chamber, 1m diameter
10 freq counters, equally spaced around the ring
add this to research plan with numbers

temp sensors on chips - best handling of that
including controls? airflow through ring....nah, will be minimal heating


1 test per control, don't sextuple count them
